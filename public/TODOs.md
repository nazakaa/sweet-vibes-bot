# This file contains a list of things that need to be done sorted by priority (most important first).

### Current Backend tasks:

-   translate compliments (pobably using [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs))
-   schedule jobs (e.g sending a compliment every 3 hours)
-   fix `eslint` errors

### Current Frontend tasks:

-   translate the app to other languages (probably using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/))
-   `exit` command
-   add settings page:
    -   language (en / ua)
    -   notifications

### Further ideas:

-   like compliments and store them in database
-   say "thank you" to the developer
-   add logger to log activity and errors
-   prank mode
-   advancements (like o 100-th compliemnt you get a special message)
-   send a compliment to a friend (advertising)
-   attach a photo to a compliment
-   change mode: "compliment" / "quote" / "joke"
-   on-demands definitions of words for non-english speakers

### ???

-   how to use chatGPT-3 to generate compliments

## Concepts:

### task tracker

-   complements as achievemnt-points
-   add task and get a compliment after it is done
-   +1 complement if task is done and -1 if not
-   exchange compliements on some ocassions (every 10 tasks)
-   statiscs and comparison with other users
-   competition system (like a leaderboard - just show the place of the user)
